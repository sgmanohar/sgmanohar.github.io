[Properties]
Corpus callosum=Connects the two cerebral hemispheres. A bundle of nerve fibres, usually corticocortical axons from the pyramidal cells in layer V of the cortex, that project to layer VI of the neighbouring cortex. If the fibres are lesioned, a syndrome results in which the two halves of the cortex do not communicate with each other readily.
Fornix=Fibre bundle from hippocampus to mammillary bodies. It is a bilateral structure formed from hippocampal axons, which travel posterodorsally proximal to the cingulate gyrus.
