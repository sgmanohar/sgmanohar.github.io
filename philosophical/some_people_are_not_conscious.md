#Some people are not conscious
#Summary
- Consciousness is about being here now - which is not physical.
- The threshold for consciousness is high.
- Many people have a strong intuition that there is no mystery of consciousness.
- On balance, these people are not conscious. This could be due to biological variability.
# 1. Why do I think I am conscious?
## 1.0. Consciousness, for the purposes of this discussion, does not overlap with cognition. 
1.0.1. Cognition is about thinking, emoting, perceiving, acting etc. - i.e. all things that can be expressed in terms of representations or processes. Cognition also includes higher order thoughts and metacognition, all kinds of memory, and even the process by which we form the belief that we are conscious. 

1.0.2. Consciousness, on the other hand, is about having a unique perspective, an inner being that separates me from everyone else. There is a sense in which everything exists from my own point of view. There is a unique "now", and a unique "here". No cognitive or physical science can help us find out which timepoint is "now", or why I am in my head rather than in yours.
These, to me, are the characteristic features of consciousness. In the following discussion, consciousness should not be confused with cognition.

1.1. Thinking purely rationally, perhaps I cannot know for certain that I am conscious. After all, what if I imagine a world where all my brain operations were identical, but I was not conscious? I would still report “I am conscious”. Many philosophers rule out such a world as logically impossible a priori, so simply believing you are conscious means that you are. A priori arguments often stem from definitions, and here that would amount to something like “I can prove from logic alone that, given just physical facts about my brain, it must have a point of view”. Remarkably, for those people, knowing that they are conscious often hinges on this. That seems a strange position to be in. 

If you are one of those people, you do not experience the intense feeling of being the centre of all existence, to the extent that you have no direct evidence for anything other than your own inner world. In short, you do not have consciousness. Or at least, you do not experience being in the way that some other people do. 

1.2. But if I am not one of those philosophers, and I could entertain the possibility of things being physically identical but without me being conscious, then I might still want to defend my knowledge. For this to work, there must be something else that makes me believe that I am conscious. What sort of thing could justify my belief? One possibility is that there is something inexpressible about simply being a subject - what it is like to be ‘within’ rather than outside - that justifies my belief. This seems right to me. But crucially, this cannot affect what I say. The subjectivity has no causal power within the brain. In other words, my verbalisable belief that I am conscious is not rationally inferred from my being conscious. 
2. Why do I think other people are conscious?
2.1. I have quite high standards for consciousness. I would suggest that I am not conscious when I am asleep, nor when I am talking nonsense while heavily intoxicated. I might not even be conscious when having a conversation while I am half-asleep, or under the influence of drugs. By extrapolation, I would suggest that patients in late-stage dementia are no longer conscious, and neither are babies. Probably many animals lack consciousness too. What about other people? I don’t relax my standard of proof for them either!

2.2. One argument for other people being conscious is the apparent symmetry with myself. They behave like me, their brains look and function like mine.  I could have (it would seem) been born as anybody else. But this is contaminated by the most striking violation of symmetry you can imagine: I am not anybody else, and I have just a single point of view - this one. The world revolves around me. There is a single “here” and “now”. From within myself, the symmetry argument seems vacuous. Another argument is that I should believe your testament that you are conscious - just as I believe other testament. But as we established in section 1, a non-conscious being could behave identically to you.  So in summary, the burden of proof is on you, to convince me that you are conscious. 
3. Who is conscious, then?
3.1. I have spoken to a lot of people about this. Many people honestly do not think there is a “problem of consciousness”. They simply don’t see any major philosophical problem - consciousness is just a function; it is a property of the way we behave. I want to suggest the possibility that these people simply are not conscious.

3.2. Some of them are philosophers, who recognise that talk about a first person perspective or a cartesian subject generates conceptual confusions. Some are biologists who believe consciousness itself has evolutionary benefit, and is just a way of describing certain aspects of cognition. But perhaps none of these academics are conscious. The person who comes to me and says, “I do not understand the mystery of consciousness!” - he alone is conscious.

3.3. It might come as a bit of a surprise for some of you, to discover that you are not conscious, in the way that some other people are. But it should not be surprising, because if reasoning is possible without subjectivity, you might equally reason that you are conscious even if you are not .

3.4. Furthermore, since human consciousness is strongly coupled to biology, individual variability seems inevitable. We have all kinds of anatomical variants, skin colours and mental traits. I would be quite surprised if everybody had consciousness to the same extent.

Ultimately I argue that different people’s brains have different biology, generating different kinds of neural events. This diversity is quenched by the brain’s overall ability to learn and emulate the same kinds of behaviour and forms of thinking. Because of this ability to acquire standardised ways of talking, we all self-identify as being conscious. But crucially, different people talk about it in different ways, which exposes the internal differences. I claim that some people are more conscious than others. The centuries-old debates in philosophy are the evidence that should make us think: despite the fact that we all use the same kind of everyday words for subjective experience, there are clearly internal differences between how other people, and I, have experience (or do not, as the case may be).  On this account, consciousness is not purely epiphenomenal: it can manifest subtly in behaviour, elicited by the right kind of questioning. 
4. Isn’t consciousness on a continuum?
4.1. It is possible that there are grades of consciousness. Indeed I used the phrase “half-asleep” earlier, which could indicate half-consciousness. One argument against binary yes-or-no consciousness is that we have to go from embryo to adult, and there is a continuum from bacterium to human (‘sorites’ arguments). It sounds absurd to identify one moment when a child becomes conscious, or one species that suddenly was the first to be conscious? But I argue this might not be so absurd. The world is full of edges and nonlinearities. Cooled water turns to ice at a critical temperature. Crystals forming in solution have a clear boundary. A conscious transition cannot be ruled out. Personally, I experience such a transition every night, where my world vanishes into nothingness in a specious instant. 

4.2. Such considerations make it clear that consciousness is very closely tied to physical events in the brain. But this does not mean that all arrangements of matter generate some degree of consciousness -- in the same sense that water is not “to some degree solid”. A physical brain correlate of consciousness does not entail panpsychism. I suggest that analogies like cooling and crystallisation are more apt that they seem: they involve “symmetry breaking”. In the case of consciousness, consciousness breaks the symmetry between minds, with one being special --  being mine.

4.3. Note that the argument that consciousness is variable across people is orthogonal to the question of whether consciousness is all-or-none. Variability in degree of consciousness could also be coupled to biological variability. 

5.0 Ultimately we face the question of when we should label someone as having consciousness or not (or something in between). I suggest that the divergence between people in the way they introspect and discuss consciousness should be grounded in differences in consciousness. For example, what should we say about someone who declares they are conscious, and agrees this is hard to explain, but then reports that they do not feel special, or denies that they have any perspective that cannot be explained by an objective 3rd person view? What should we say about someone who agrees that there is a single time called now but it is not singular or unique? What about someone who agrees there is a first-person perspective, but asserts all first-person perspectives are equal, and theirs has no special status? We could do one of three things: a) We can accuse them of contradiction (e.g., There cannot be a first person, if you do not agree that you are the one.). b) Or more generously, we can determine that their idea of first person, consciousness etc, differ drastically from our own. We may never understand how they can say such incoherent things, but we can assure ourselves that this seems coherent to them. They simply do not have consciousness, at least not in the way I experience it and describe it. c) We could bite the bullet and say that they are also conscious. But this suffers from deep circularity: 


Footnotes


() Here I will not discuss being conscious of something. Rather, I mean being conscious per se. These two meanings are probably aligned though: when I am conscious of something, there is a subjective side to it. Cognitively, and so physically, my mind has content. But non-physically, there is also subjective experience. For example, pain is computed and represented by cognition; but separably, this computed representation is experienced. Is there a connection between whether mental content is experienced or not, and whether there is a personal point of view or not?
NOTE that non-reportability and non-rememberability of my movements when driving is not equal to me being unconscious of them.



Outline
Some people do not experience a continual surprise and awe that everything is from their viewpoint alone. These people do not feel that being right here, right now, is special. They think it fits in fine with their physical world, even though physics doesn’t allow any one time to be special. 

I seek to explain why some people do not think there is much mystery to consciousness.

I argue that it is because these people are not conscious. To make this work,
I argue that facts about whether we are conscious or not can come apart from our belief or declaration that we are conscious. 
This is due to the unique way that consciousness is defined as purely subjective.
People can discover more about themselves by comparing notes with other people. E.g., realising you are a synaesthete, colour blind, or have eidetic memory or autistic traits.
This opens a noncircular way to define whether someone is conscious or not. 

The argument
is orthogonal to physicalism and dualism debates. It works at the level of an operational definition of consciousness.
is orthogonal to all-or-none nature of consciousness
is orthogonal to nature-nurture contribution to variability
does not assume all consciousness is biological (and might be equally valid for AI)

# Caveats
It requires a high threshold for consciousness (animals, babies and drunk people beware)
Maybe we should just create a new term for this, rather than butcher ‘consciousness’. For example “deeply conscious” vs “shallowly conscious” people, or  “consciousness with awe” vs “consciousness without awe”.
Admittedly, “accessing your inner self” must be a purely physical process (if physics is causally complete), so it remains difficult to see how it reflects anything nonphysical.



# How I realised that death is an illusion
Death is an absolute end -- in particular, an end to a person’s consciousness. Death happens at a given clock time, and means that a person was conscious before that time, but it is no longer possible that they could be conscious after that time. 
This sounds obvious, but it is not. It relies on a particular idea of time, and personal identity through time. It presupposes we know whether any two conscious experiences, at two different instants, belong to the same person. And we must know under what situations you remain the “same conscious person” over time.

The first step is to convince yourself that there is a problem. What is wrong with our intuitions? Surely I am the same person as I think I was a few minutes ago? Throughout history, many situations have been described that make us worry that this is not a certainty.
1. Teleporting and copying
You may have heard of this famous series of thought experiments. 
Experiment 1: (copying)  The positions of each atom of your body are measured by a new kind of MRI scanner. A new kind of atomic-force 3D printer then assembles a copy of your body. 
Experiment 2: (teleporting) The MRI scanner reads all you atoms' positions, and at the same time as the copy is made, your original body is disassembled.
Experiment 3: (simulating) The positions are read, and sent to a supercomputer. Physics simulation software runs your body, close to real time. This may or may not leave behind a copy, like E1 vs E2. 
A few points to note: E2 is very similar to 
E2a: (Theseus) It turns out that, after a year, all of the atoms in my body have been replaced. It is like E2, except that in E2 it happens all at once.  
E2b: (walking) I walk two steps forward. All my atoms have moved. This is similar to E2, except that E2 involves a new set of atoms, meaning that links such as quantum states are brokena. 
Contrast copying with teleporting: it seems odd that simply leaving a copy behind would affect whether the printer is printing you or not.

E4: (null) nothing happens, I stay still. This is the epitome of remaining the same person. Every atom has moved, but not by much. Can I be sure, from just internal considerations, that I am the same person as I was before? Perhaps it is analytically it trivially true (after all, what would it mean if I were not?). . 

Memory as continuity
For: you’d feel morally responsible for previous actions. And be treated as if you are responsible. You’d believe you are the same person. 
Against: memory drugs or alcohol shouldn’t be enough to disrupt personhood. You could remove memories one at a time, and when would you suddenly stop being the same person? You can be very forgetful and have hallucinations, but presumably be the same person.
# 2. Time
To understand death, we need to understand time. Time has been extensively discussed in philosophy and physics. But I am not a philosopher or a physicist, I am a neuroscientist. Neuroscientists don’t discuss time as much as they ought to, so I’ll have a go here. 

Physicists often see time as laid out in front of them. The past goes in one direction, the future in the other. This perspective helps them in many ways.  A moment in time is a slice. They can trace out an object’s continued existence, like a line.  They can instantaneously compare two points in time, just by looking at two points in space. And this helps them build laws that stay the same at all times -- i.e.  the symmetries in space help them see the symmetry over time. 

But this may be no more than a metaphor, because we cannot really see different times. We cannot directly compare them. To do anything like that, we have to use our memory. In an extreme case, the symmetries we see in time could be artifacts of applying the same kinds of cognition to sensations and to memories. 
Experiences are lonely and isolated
What is a single experience? It is an event, occurring at a place and time (assuming space and time are real -- or if they are just mental, then the event at least has properties of perceived location and time), 
The experience feels like it is the most recent episode after a long sequence of events.It feels like this in virtue of the memories of previous experiences. The current experience is contrasted with previous memories. 
Memories are current
What happens when I remember the past, or liken my current experience to a previous one? Memory involves remembering something, by referring to something that is past. The process of remembering involves brain synapses corresponding to previous experiences are activated. In that sense, remembering is  a process that happens now. It can be explained entirely by processes occurring in the present. In a different but important sense, memory refers to the past and, as such, is partly dependent on past events.
 
I think that we can agree that there is a time called “now”. But any time is physically capable of being a “now”. No laws of physics can tell you which time is now. And this means that whatever determines which time is now, must live and operate outside of physics.  

So what is it that makes us the same consciousness as our past self? A common view is that it is memory. Sharing suffient memories with our past conscious events makes us the same person. This has some intuitive appeal. Scientifically, we might say that enough information from our past experience colours our present experience. There is information shared or transferred between the two experiences, which means they are part of the same consciousness. 
# 3. What makes you special?
Symmetry is the core of physics. Is is the assumption that that lets us generalise: eg that physical laws are the same everywhere and at every time. Symmetry means that nobody's perspective should be special. No person, and no time, is more real or actual than another.  But this means that physics cannot tell which time is now, or which brain is me. In fact, from a physics perspective, "now" is not a time; it is a way of making reference that happens in a brain, and is presumably a process that occurs in time. The same is true of "I', “me” and “this”. 
You cannot experience other peoples’ thoughts


Freud commented that when we remember a dream, we often remember it having occurred over 20 minutes or even an hour. But, he noticed, this does not correspond to the time we were actually asleep: we can have a 20 minute dream in the space of a couple of minutes asleep. The dream time, he realised, is established at the time of remembering the dream once we are fully awake. The dream experiences were indeed experienced, but the dream time intervals do not match with real time intervals. There are many other examples of where subjective time does not correspond to real time. What conclusion can we draw from this? 

In a similar vein, Bertrand Russell once stated, “For all I know, I could have been born 2 minutes ago.” By this, he meant that there was no way of knowing whether my memories of the past were actual occurrences, or were just implanted memories. What Russel paints as a skepticism about memory, Freud deems an important feature of how the human mind works. 

4. Split brains and neural communication
Each subregion of your brain is computing things, so if computation is the key to being conscious, then each subregion of your brain is contributing to your consciousness. This makes intuitive sense in neuroscience where different parts of our internal world are represented in different brain areas. It is very interesting, then, when brain connections are cut, a person can behave as if he contains multiple agents. For example the right hand and left hand can disagree, and come to different conclusions (reviewed in ...). It seems dangerous to say that this person now contains two consciousnesses, but this is one interpretation. If so, then in the healthy brain, what is it that makes the left and right hand contribute to one single consciousness? Perhaps two computations contribute to the same consciousness if they are (sufficiently) informationally interconnected. 

5. Continuum of communication
What makes minds separate?
Let’s assume communication between brain areas makes us a single conscious being. There is a corollary: the lack of communication between two brains is what makes them contribute to different consciousnesses.So the reason why I cannot experience your thoughts is simply that my brain does not have enough interconnectivity with your brain. 

The imminent reality of mental prosthetics
Another corollary is that it should be possible to create connections between my brain and other computational processes. If these connections are sufficiently strong, then perhaps those computations, and my own, will be part of the same consciousness. Whether silicon computation is of the right kind to support consciousness, that is not a question we can answer yet. But, if we had biologically-based brain prosthetics, then there is in principle no obstacle. We should consider this possibility as an imminent reality. 
Violating the privacy of the mind
It is remarkable that our brains are encapsulated in an inert skull, with only a dozen nerves coming in and out. The brain is deliberately isolated from the world. But yet, we all communicate. Information passes from mind to mind, at great speed. If mental separateness is a matter of communication, then we are already not so distinct from one another. 
Perhaps there is a threshold for a set of computations, above which they  “contribute to one single consciousness”. It might be a bandwidth, or a density of computation, or something else. But if communication is important, then perhaps we lie somewhere on the continuum of being a single consciousness, vs being completely separate ones.

Why do we feel that time moves?
So physics does not tell us which time is now. In fact, at any physical time where there is an active brain, there is a now. In fact there is a now for every brain, every perspective. 

But the moment of now does not move - after all, what would it move through? It cannot move through time, because what speed would it move at (how many seconds per second?). Rather, all these moments are now, all together. 

Why do we describe it as moving? Well there are very few metaphors available for us to describe the relations we experience between memory and prospective brain processes.
The sense of movement comes from the way we encode and compute with episodic memories.


 I can be afraid of my future experiences before I die. But I am not afraid of death itself - of death as an end. From this perspective, it does not seem like an end.
 
Ultimately we have to take all the arguments with a pinch of salt. I cannot be wrong about feeling a pain. And maybe in the same way, I cannot be wrong about death being a final end. From my point of view, it is. But if we take the perspective of our instantaneous consciousness, it is not. 



# Does consciousness have a function? 
Would a copy of you be you? 

If there is no problem of consciousness, then we are owed solutions to a number of problems:
What happens to me during fission? And in the continuum of scenarios with partial teleportation?
Who exists after callosotomy? After other diaschisis, surgical or stroke-induced?
Who experiences events during TGA?
Is there responsibility when we have fully deterministic accounts of brain function? (this is quite plausible given neurons are all-or-none amplifiers, which annul chaotic or quantum effects)
What makes a radical sceptic foolish? And what makes the pyrrhonian foolish? (if there is a problem of consciousness, we can honestly say “nothing”.)
Is a full simulation of brain processes conscious? 
If not, where is the threshold on the continuum of neuron substitution? 
If so, how forgiving is it on the continuum of artificial neural networks with similar behaviours (down to lookup tables / Chinese rooms)?
When do babies become conscious? Animals in evolution? (or is this a matter of definition)
How come you are you?
What is now? It’s not a property of the physical (4D) world.
Specifically it seems there’s no way to know what the time is now. You might say that the answer depends on the context of the utterance - i.e. the time you’re currently asking the question. But this is circular: the time at which the utterance is said is what is unknown, and the speaker needs to know. Stating that the question is answered by your perspective simply begs the question of what the time is. Or perhaps it pushes the question up one level: how to know what time an utterance occurred.   


Those who believe there is no problem of consciousness may like to appeal to physicalism about facts. They might claim that sentences involving “now” and “I” -- sentences like “It’s 3pm”, or “I’m Sanjay” -- are non-factual, or perhaps, pseudofacts. They are not evaluated with respect to the world -- but rather, with respect to a particular viewpoint. Physicalists can drive a wedge between facts about the physical world, and facts that depend on perspective.  However this gets rapidly out of hand. Statements liek “This is a table” also seem pseudofactual. Ultimately, the sentences that seem purely physical, like “There is an electron at xyzt=(100m,100m,100m,100s) relative to the big bang”, also suffer from the word electron being defined contextually and in a subject-dependent manner. Simply admitting a chink of subjectivity with “now” and “I” threatens to open us up to a strongly structuralist and relativist account of factual meaning. In other words, excluding indexicals from physical facts threatens to remove all external reference from propositions. 
[[ And hence we end up with a problem of consciousness again.  ]]


Believing that there is  a problem of consciousness won’t help us answer these questions. But at least it helps us acknowledge that they are difficult questions. 
However, believing in the problem would however, lead us to struggle with questions like 
Why did consciousness evolve?
If physics is complete and closed, then how can we ever know whether we are conscious? And if we cannot, on what grounds is there a problem?
