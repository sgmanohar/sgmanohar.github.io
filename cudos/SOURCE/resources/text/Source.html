<H1>Source</H1>
This component produces a basic waveform. Select the kind of wave you want on the panel on the right.
If you create an 'Output' component, and drag its left-hand (input) terminal onto the output terminal of a 'Source component, you will see the waveform in the graph at the bottom. (Press the 'Start' button on the left hand side)
<P>
There are several kinds of waveform:
<LIST>
<LI>Const</LI> gives a constant value, specified by amplitude.
<LI>Saw</LI> gives a sawtooth wave, which gradually increases until it reaches its maximum (specified by the amplitude), then suddenly drops back down to the minimum value.
<LI>Ramp</LI> gives a value that ascends and descends linearly between the limits of the amplitude.
<LI>Sine</LI> gives a sinusoidal waveform.
<LI>Comb</LI> gives a periodic transient spike, like the teeth of a comb.
<LI>Square</LI> gives a square wave, which alternates between the maximum and minimum value, as specified by the amplitude.
<LI>Truncate</LI> gives a truncated version of the 'ramp' waveform, such that it reaches a plateau at the maximum and minimum values.
