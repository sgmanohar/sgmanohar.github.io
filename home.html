    Through computational neuroscience, 
    we try to work out what steps someone takes, 
    in their brain, when they think or act. 
    Our research group applies these ideas 
    to three domains that are affected by neurological illnesses:

            <h3>Motivation</h3>

            <p>
                Motivation drives us to do things.
                Many brain disorders impair motivation, 
                causing apathy or impulsivity.
                This can be catastrophic, leaving patients disabled, 
                and is of course very stressful for carers. 
                Understanding the anatomy and chemistry of motivation 
                may permit treatments of these disorders.

            <h3>Artificial intelligence</h3>

            <p>
            Artificial intelligence (AI) studies how thoughts could be
            made up from simple computations. 
            AI is a rapidly evolving field and is currently 
            dominated by neural networks,
            which use basic arithmetic - like adding and multiplying numbers -
            to generate complex behaviours.
            By comparing these networks to the brain,
            we can understand diseases that produce 
                abnormal thoughts and behaviours.

                Remembering what we have just seen, done, or are about to do,
                is a natural ability for most of us.
                However certain diseases can interfere
                with these kinds of short-term memory.
                    By studying how groups of neurons interact
                    to retain information over brief intervals,
                    we may begin to understand how this goes wrong 
                    in neurodegenerative diseases.
