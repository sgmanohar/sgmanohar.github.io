This component allows you to specify a value as a function of time, using a mathematical formula. The function is evaluated every instant, with the new value of 't', to give the output of the component. The value of 't' increases monotonically, and is currently an integer that is incremented with each cycle of calculation.

Type the formula in the box on the lower right, under f(t). Example formulae would be 
<PRE>
random()
sin(0.2*t)
min(sin(0.2*t),sin(0.3*t))
</PRE>
You may use any of Java's pre-defined mathematical functions. These are listed <A href=MathsFunctions.html>here</A>.
<P>
Errors in the formula may appear underneath the box in which you have typed.
