The illusion of willpower
Willpower is something we experience when we are aware of a natural tendency to do an action A, but we simultaneously become aware of another (less natural) tendency to do an action B. This experience can be present whether or not the tendency to B actually supervenes over A, that is, irrespective of which action A or B actually occurs.

By using the word ‘natural’ to describe the tendency to A, we say it takes less effort. In states of lower motivation, attention, and mental effort, A is more likely to occur than B. It is ‘easier’.

What constitutes a choice? There are two types of choice. 
1.	The first occurs if action A and B can not physically co-occur. The definition of each action precludes the occurrence of the other. An example might be pushing a lever to the left or the right, or equally, pressing a button versus not pressing it. 
2.	The second kind of choice occurs when we are asked to constrain our response to either A or B. In this situation, although A and B could theoretically co-occur, this is forbidden by a psychological constraining rule. An example might be pressing button A with the left hand, or pressing button B with the right hand. The rule is usually contingent on context (in this case, ‘press only one of A or B’). However if these rules are essentially constant for an individual, the two types of choice can be difficult to distinguish.

Charity acquits government of responsibility for equality
Charities must go.
The solution is perhaps that the government must buy out all charities, raise taxes, provide a ‘charitable causes decision unit’, and fund each according to assessed needs.
Here I will outline three reasons why charities should be banned.

1. Economic
Charity is clearly a way in which richer people can contribute to the equal distribution of wealth by giving freely by acts of compassion. In this sense it boosts economic growth (by recycling capital from capitalists), and increases socioeconomic equality.
However, the implementation is highly unsatisfactory. 
Charities, by their nature, must compete with each other for public empathy. Most commonly this involves spending money on advertising. This money could better be spent on the charity’s cause itself. It should not be acceptable for donated money to be spent on anything other than the structures that actually provide help.
One could argue that advertising raises public awareness of the problem the charity is designed to solve. But what good does raising public awareness do? It simply helps them get more money, because charity relies on empathy. [See section 3]. But this if this is regarded as an ‘investment’, we could equally ask, should charities be allowed to invest donated money?
Charities, as regulated bodies, have obligations to the public to spend carefully. But the constant need to promote a cause leads to exaggerations and distortions of needs. 
The market in which charities compete is not even a fair one: the more a charity has to invest in advertising, the more attention and therefore money it will receive. The bias is towards charities that are already larger, so that the partitioning of money is distorted compared to needs. One could argue that smaller scale charities in fact need more than larger ones by proportion, as they have higher overheads, and also require more research since their areas are less well understood. 

2. Public should not decide on such issues
Moreover, most people in general will never know enough to make the best decision about where money should go. Consider a small sum of money from each person. If it were pooled together, there is an optimal way of distributing it, to benefit society. This will depend on:
•	all the possible charities: their goals, aims, and beliefs 
•	their financial mechanism: what they plan to spend on, how much, how often, and how long for. 
•	the number and type of people who will be benefited
•	the amount of benefit (utility) each person will get
a) Knowing all this about every charitable cause is no mean feat, and requires a large coordinated civil department to digest this information, examine the needs of the state, and create an allocation plan between the causes.
It is evidently wrong to place this matter in the hands of people who are informed on the basis of small numbers of adverts, each of which pleads only its own cause. [cf my arguments against true democracy, and for totalitarianism]
b) Even in a situation where we credit the public with knowledge and understanding of all this, we are still far from a democratic situation, because a small number of rich people own the whole vote!

3. Adverts and awareness of suffering can be psychologically harmful
Often it is argued that knowing that other people are suffering is essential for normal human nature: 
•	it provides us with perspective on our own fortune (makes us feel better about ourselves)
•	it makes us feel better about paying tax
•	it is our right to know things about other people
•	it is the right of suffering people, that we know about them
However, the opposite view is rarely stressed:
a)	Raising public awareness is distracting for the public. People have other things to do than think about charities. Feeling miserable about other people’s misfortune is both unpleasant for the well-off, and also degrading for the sufferers. Mental energy spent on emotions directed at anonymous, unidentifiable individuals is arguably far less human and wholesome than emotions directed towards friends and acquaintances. [cf giving to a tramp]. The overdramatisation of charitable needs, for example with images and individual case stories (which is a consequence of the competitive market for empathy) is a failed attempt to overcome this, and probably both demeans the recipient and vexes the potential donor.
b)	The feeling of obligation to pay an unspecified amount generates nausea/angst. There is no limit to how generous one can be: it creates a tension between the self and the other. The anonymity of both benefactor and recipient guarantees that the sole psychological effect of charity on the donor is guilt, which can only be absolved by donation.
c)	There are instances where receiving charity can promote helplessness. It even generates the feeling of a right to such benefits: although often it is true that individuals have rights to these benefits, it is very rarely a good thing that feeling that one has these rights is a good thing. It leads to feelings of unrest with others, of being owed or short-changed, and resentment. Such feelings may not be out of place when directed at a bad government; however they are unacceptable when directed at the public, or unknown individuals. [e.g. rude beggar]

Corollaries:
Rich hermits who die cannot bequeath money to charity: 100% tax applies.
Charities that run as trusts, operating entirely from invested capital, may remain under the condition they receive no further donations.
An option open to hermits, is therefore, to set up a company before they die, responsible for spending their money as intended. But you may ask, how does this differ from charities? Not a great deal, but at least it does no harm to the rest of the public. 
What about large capitalist corporations that regularly donate to charity? Although this appears a good thing at first sight, all three criticisms apply here. Producing corporate identity and good ethos are commendable but flawed. There needs to be a system where profits are taxed highly, so that companies that attain a level of success must de jure contribute.

Psychological models define closed regions of algorithm space; experiments partition space into two.
Algorithms can be written in computer programs in the form of functions. Recent developments have shown that computer functions, under certain constraints, are differentiable. This opens the way for a strong connection between general computational algorithms, and mathematical functions. Analysis of mathematical functions allows each algorithm to be identified with a point in an high (likely infinite)-dimensional space. Metrics such as function similarity could be added to this algorithm space.
Can we assume that a single brain performing a particular task uses a single algorithm, which is repeated identically on several trials? If so, the result of an experiment will give information about this algorithm.
A specific experimental finding could be thought of as partitioning the algorithm space in two – the algorithms that are compatible with the results, and the algorithms that are not. Experimental psychology is therefore the process of arranging multiple experimental conditions such that we rapidly reduce the size of the possible algorithm space. To do this, the experimenter must try to ‘corner’ the algorithm in an enclosed region – to delimit the candidate algorithms – by generating data that determine the boundaries of how the algorithm might operate.
Critical differences to normal approaches are:
•	Models are not single algorithms but regions of space. All those algorithms are compatible with the model; the model cannot distinguish between certain algorithms, as it generates the same empirical predictions for them.
•	Each experimental result helps to whittle down the large set of possible ways in which the brain performs a task
•	The resulting set is always an infinite set, but is smaller. In other words, we cannot find a ‘single way’ in which the brain performs the task, but a collection of similar ways that are all equally likely candidates.

A more plausible (but less tractable) way of setting this out, is that each experimental finding gives a degree of evidence:
•	We will have prior expectations about what kinds of algorithms might be used
•	The experimental evidence will be noisy
•	And we expect that the same algorithm might be used in other similar experiments.   
Therefore we consider each experimental result as altering the posterior probability of each algorithm being the one used by the brain. We can construct a prior probability density over the space of possible functions, and each experimental result has a likelihood over the possible algorithms.
The differences between this and normal hypothesis-driven approaches are that:
•	one must explicity state one’s prior
•	interpreting the experimental finding must be taken in the context of this prior

This approach could benefit from topological analysis – in terms of whether experiments can produce disconnected regions, open/closed sets, non-compact sets etc. 
When are nearby algorithms behaviourally distinguishable? If we have no access to the neurophysiology or ‘internal states’ used by the algorithm, there could be algorithms that are indistinguishable. Behavioural distinctions are primarily made two methods:
1.	by examining ‘Big O’: how completion time relates to a number of input variables.
2.	by examining the result / answer given.

To dismiss the hard problem of consciousness, one must demonstrate why it is meaningless to ask “Why am I in my brain, not yours?”
This question can be phrased in several ways, which render it more or less opaque / susceptible to criticism. For example, “Why is everything from a single point-of-view, not multiple?”; “Why am I me not you?”, “Why am I in my head not yours?”, “Why can’t I experience your thoughts”. One must show how these questions presuppose a fallacy, or at least, are based upon a cognitive misconstruction of the notion of ‘I’. If a misconstruction is the fundamental problem here, it must be a pervasive, systematic, or even innate one, given the propensity of human nature to ask such questions.

Natural kinds depend on the mind
Natural kinds cannot make sense. They rely on separating perceived categorisations from physical ones (e.g. red-green perception). But often perceived categorisation is highly functional, and omnipresent - blood, fruit, traffic lights. So how to make the separation? cf magnitude scaling for microscopic/cosmological sizes, or the Fechner law - these determine what we call natural kinds; nay, what CAN be called n.k., since nothing can be perceived without these constraints. could these two kinds of natural kinds be the only natural metakinds? The psychological natural kinds gain support from experience, whereas those deemed independent of mind make little sense.

Amount of consciousness as path integral of a space-time scalar field; Experience as rate of destruction of possible worlds
Being conscious or not of an (epiphenomenal) quale could not make me say that i experience it. Not can it make me believe anything about qualia. Thus such beliefs are detached from whether or not we have qualia. This voids my claim that natural variation in how conscious people are is responsible for heterogeneity of belief in qualia. The heterogeneity must be attributed to a true cognitive faculty (i.e. one with a physical basis). What is the faculty that determines this belief that i am conscious? Jackson says it is a modal intuition. Wittgenstein says it is linguistic. Others say it is higher order thought / metacognition.
In the broad picture, laws of noncontradiction take on the epistemic status of "we ought not to have contradictions", or even "boo on contradiction". This follows from strong conceivability of possible minds.

The structure of the mind is such that it is able to conceive of itself as thinking something that it did not "want" to think. In general, we think what we want to think, given no input and free time. This cannot be by definition, otherwise we would not have separability of the concepts of "wanting to think" and thinking. --> Can one found an idealist morality based on the deterministic future as being "good" - somewhat akin to the way evolution arrives at a concept of "development" and "complexity"?

Why does life require such a narrow temperature band? is it because of our spatiaotemporal scaling?

We perceive sizes relative to ourselves, but we have an incredible faculty for imagining “zooming in or out” in scale. According to this counterfactual scaling faculty, we can imagine being tiny or huge, and we can imagine seeing the world from these scales. In particular, the human mind is apt to look for symmetries of scale, and ask ourselves whether rules we have abstracted at our actual scale, would apply at other scales. For example, we can mentally image the solar system, and “see” how it parallels an orrery, or even atoms. (Hofstadter invokes such a faculty to explain the beauty of fractals.) 

Phenomenologically, we might paraphrase this: the content of mental representations is not absolutely scaled; only the scale relative to other mental representations are fixed. I.e., mental representations would be invariant under homogeneous isotropic transformations of the physical world. Philosophers use this ability to argue that, were the spatial scale of everything to change (see Ian Phillips PhD thesis), we could not know it nor detect it. The mental lacks anchoring. 

My own take on this (as an idealist) is to disregard it as unpuzzling: it is not that the mental lacks anchoring to real physical sizes. Rather, the world itself has no absolute physical sizes. Our mental propensity to imagine our representations as needing scaling arises from our counterfactual faculty of taking on imaginary scaled viewpoints.

But irrespective of our viewpoint as regards to whether the world has an absolute scale, we can find handles in the world that seem to fix functionally important scales. For example, atoms and stars do form “hard-coded” boundaries of size. In general, several boundary conditions arise from laws of physics that hard-code the sizes of various kinds of structure. In general these boundary conditions will depend on physical constants, but provide constraints on our arbitrarily conceived scaling of the world. All sizes appear to be relative to these boundaries. 

But similar constraints apply to time too, relating time to space in rigid ways. Oscillation frequencies, nuclear decay rates, and velocities produce yardsticks that, again by physical constants, fix time’s scale relative to space. 

Thus physical constants root the scale of the perceived world within possible worlds. My counterfactual scenarios can choose to change my own viewpoint’s scale, or to change physical constants. 

Now we can address the question of whether the scales of life are special. One of the most biologically salient constraints is temperature. Organisms as we know them simply cannot reproduce below 273 K or above 323 K. One response to this is that we have a very narrow conception of what counts as a living organism. Perhaps some form of life exists at other temperatures? One might argue that our temperature limit is directly coupled to the organism’s physical scale relative to the boundary conditions.

The future of intelligence needs careful planning
If we are to play God, we have to study His role, take on His demeanour and comportment, and crucially, see the world from His point of view. I hope to see as far into the future as I possibly can. Although some of the conclusions I draw may be surprising and unpleasant, and although some of them may be incorrect, they do follow reasonably from our current state as an intelligent species.

The short-sighted and selfish desires of the individual must be quenched, and the future of intelligent life must be considered. If humans are important for future intelligence (i.e. we are not simply superseded by a different kind of organism that is more intelligent), then the survival of the human race is important. Survival does not entail expansion in numbers – moreover expansion may give rise to difficulties. 

To maximise the race’s production, we should all die at 65, until we learn how to stop ageing. I will give three justifications of this.
A) Fairness: Currently we all carry genes that make us live longer or shorter; sometimes this is by direct biological effect; other times this is by altering behaviours via neurogenetics. Either way, a component of longevity may be in us at birth. Rawls’s original position argument might suggest that our prospects from birth (opportunity, quality of life, longevity) should be kept as equal as possible. One fair way of promoting equality would be to deny medical care to all over 65. Now the human soul finds deliberately denying life to anyone a horrific proposal. But we are already on a spectrum in which many people are denied life, and others are granted it, and critically, the resources required to prolong life are not equally distributed. 
B) Productivity: We have many options on how to define productivity, but in general, it means leading a life that makes a contribution or a difference to the future of the race. In some periods of human history, brute force, alertness and caution were essential for a productive life. Later in history, a variety of traits can be productive, and how productive a trait is depends firstly on its prevalence in the population. One can have too many mathematical minds, just as one can have too many farmers. Secondly it depends on technology available to the race: machines replace some labour; computers replace many numerical tasks. Such changes in the balance of traits that are productive make it vital that we maintain flexible variety in the pool of human traits. In this way, the balance of traits prevalent in the population can dynamically adjust to technology.
One rather mercenary approach might be to permit prolongation of life to those who remain productive. Clearly this improves the race’s productivity, but since we all have different abilities at birth, it would violate the principle of fairness.  
C) Resources: even if available resources were to be suddenly increased, the death age may not increase. Resources may mean many things, for example we might discover a new source of energy, or a way to make humans require no sleep, or a way to make animals more intelligent or perform new kinds of labour. We might even enhance our own intelligence or produce AI superior to ourselves. But either way, increasing resources would allow us to choose between the following three options: 1) more people, all living just as long as before, 2) same number of people, but happier overall, and living as long as before, 3) same number, living equally happily but for longer. (Note that people living longer, with the same average death and birth rate, does not entail more people).

A very important question remains: how many people should there be on the planet? What is optimal for productivity? This depends clearly on what we mean by productivity. As I alluded to earlier, expansion of numbers alone is not a legitimate goal. We must aim for expansion plus 1) diversification of our habitat in order to allow evolutionary branching, 2) spatial spread, taking advantage of more resources, 3) improvement in life quality, which must very broadly defined, but fair, and 4) potentially allowing for developments in other forms of intelligence, as we discover more about what constitutes intelligent life – for example, artificial intelligence or life-forms encountered from elsewhere.

Without these specific but generally defined goals, we face a real danger of stagnation, extinction and regression. 

So our insatiable drive to live longer as individuals is not a noble one, compared to the future of intelligent live. How are we going to overcome our individual greed? I believe this is an easy question (though I might be wrong). We must view ourselves as the organism that is the race. The change does not call for selflessness and humility. On the contrary it calls for hubris and pride in the race, and a kind of selfishness that matches our extraordinary position in the known universe. We are a race with 1) increasing power to change our local environment, and 2) intelligence sufficient to plan these changes using our own models of the world. 
Where we might fail, is in our evolved individual selfishness. There is no doubt that we are to some extent wired to look out for ourselves, to put number one first. But to conclude the human mind is a purely a selfish organ would be to commit several errors. Cooperation is an essential and evolved feature of the majority of living organisms. It is not simply that animals benefit from co-operative behaviour. Collaboration runs so deep that it is the reason for our existence – genes must collaborate with each other and with proteins to produce a reproducing organism, and cells must collaborate to produce tissues, organs and persons.  It is not yet clear, admittedly, whether or not the network of humans across the race form a higher organism.

To talk of possibility of my mind being different we need some caution. e.g "no purposes are possible1 without the specific contingent2 construction of my mind" - here the contingence2 refers to the region of the brain conferring purpose, whereas possible1 refers to logical possibility, and thus requires us to specify a particular architecture for the brain region conferring logical possibility.

The same kind of process is occurring during perceptual noise reduction as in response inhibition - effortful recruitment or coordination of cells. May explain why some regions more active in harder value comparisons
Why dont gametes have rights? Because of the conditional probability of them "becoming" sapient.
Quantum mechanics is obsessed by measurables and observables. But in fact there are no such things as measurements or observations; only deterministic propagation and amplification of information to larger scales.
Can neuromodulators modify transmission time of axons / dendrites / synapses? If so we have a new class of primitive computational operators.
Where does spacetime curvature make different predictions to space curvature?
entitlement, warrant, justification are really bayesian descriptions of cognitive processing: given sensation x or y, I am likely to emit verbal responses a or b. P(a|x) etc etc.

is there a neural reason for the (?ubiquitous) duality of active and passive sentences
skepticism is overcome by assuming a flat prior over all distinct conceivable propositions
Empiricism dichotomises the epistemic status of sense data vs inferred laws of nature. Neuroscience (hierarchical inference) places them on a continuum, where even sense data are inferred.
