On the fear of dying


# Abstract: 
Neurobiology supports panpsychism. This kind of panpsychism paints a different picture of what time is. This leads to a different appreciation of the nature of life and death.   

# Introduction

When we look around, other people seem to be conscious. If that’s true, then a question immediately presents itself:  
Q1: Why am I in my body, not yours? If there’s very similar processes in each brain that can be experienced, then why do I only experience the things in my brain? 

One attempt to answer the question “Why don’t I experience the thoughts in your head?”,  is the following: If I did experience the thoughts in your head, then it would not be me any more, it would be you. However this begs the question, because I am experiencing my own thoughts, but I can imagine that I might be experiencing yours. 

Brain A	Brain B
    |                       |
  Me		  You


A second attempt may be to state that the contents of my brain -- let’s call it  brain A,  are different to  your brain, brain B, in some peculiar way, and I -- the experiencing I -- have some idiosyncratic property that makes me experience only those thoughts in brain A, not B. However, if we accept that brain B could support experience, then  it seems that no physical fact could determine which of brains A and B I would experience. [Pairing problem, Kim 1973]. So we end up denying physicalism and requiring some strange dualistic connections between each brain and its consciousness. 


A more sophisticated answer to this question is to notice something about the things that a particular brian can think. Brain A cannot access much of the information in brain B. It is quite isolated. In fact, even if the I was experiencing thoughts in both brain A and brain B, I would not know it. In other words, I am experiencing only the information, ideas, and thoughts that are represented in those brains. Brain A contains representations of the world from its point of view, but has no way of comparing or contrasting those representations with those in brain B. As such, there are thoughts about brain A’s view,  and about brain B’s view, but there are no thoughts about there being both views. And, there are no thoughts about there being neither view. I simply could not know that I am experiencing multiple brains’ thoughts! And I could not know because the individual brains have no wiring, no content, to represent that.

Consider a scotoma. A scotoma occurs when a part of the visual cortex is damaged, by a stroke for instance. We lose vision in one part of the visual field. If it’s in peripheral vision, most people do not notice this loss. It is as invisible as your blind spot. Most people don’t even know they have one, let alone where it is. Of course, by careful self-testing, you can find it, and eventually people turn up to hospital with scotomas. This is quite different to what happens if your retina is damaged. After retinal damage, people see a hole in their vision. This seems to be because the corresponding regions of visual cortex are not activated by the retina, and “see the hole”. Though this metaphor invokes a homunculus, it does illustrate the point that if information is not computed or represented in the brain, it is not experienced. I argue that, even if I were experiencing both brain A and B contents, the lack of any joint representation -- whether comparative or conjunctive -- is a scotoma. The scotoma here is that the conscious experience of thoughts A and B lacks any connective between them, and therefore it’s not obvious that you are experiencing both. The thoughts of A and B are experienced as two separate conscious streams: as two separate people. This happens even if there is only one fundamental consciousness experiencing both A and B, because of the scotoma. 

This is a rather unusual way to define a person. It is somewhat of a “negative” definition.  It would amount to persons being defined by a **_lack of representation_** of the connection between the representations in one brain and other brains. We could also say that our experience of having only one point of view could be an artefact of a lack of combined information between my brain and others. Perhaps I am experiencing all people’s thoughts; but it’s just that there’s an invisible and impenetrable wall between them. Or even more provocatively: perhaps my existential solitude is an illusion.  It is an essential illusion, due to the architecture of brains. 

# Information connectivity
One strange corollary of this view is that what makes me a separate person from you is a physical fact: there aren’t any connections between our brains. 
There are a number of interesting issues here. Firstly, our brains are already connected, a little bit. I hear you speak, for example. Second, the connections can be weaker or stronger. [[This would mean that I can be partially the same person as you.]] Third, it can change over time: perhaps we can connect our brains together, and fuse two people into one. Fourth, I could sever my brain and I could perhaps end up with multiple consciousnesses - this has been suggested to happen in split brain patients (Gazzaniga).


Fifth, connections are not simply weak or strong: there is an important issue of which bit is connected to which bit. I’m connected to the world via my visual cortex and motor cortex. Stimulating visual cortex causes an external perception. In contrast, stimulating downstream areas causes internal thoughts and ideas to change, without a clear perception of something external. A similar thing happens in the motor system: stimulating M1 causes an action without an intention, but stimulating upstream cortex causes intentions to act, and even further upstream is expected to change our thoughts and desires. Neurons all over the brain talk to each other, but some of those messages are experienced as external: perceiving or acting. Other messages are experienced as internal.
  

# Time
If we are only weakly connected to each other, then we should also consider how well we are connected to ourselves. Bertrand Russell (?) once said: “For all I know, I might have been born yesterday.” What he meant was that, although we have memories of our past, we don’t know for sure if they are true. 
We know that our memories are fallible - and may be partly reconstructed based on statistics, without our awareness
We know that stimulating memory centres can cause deja vu, whereas damage can cause false memories (confabulation)
So can we be sure we existed a few seconds ago? Perhaps not for sure. We are tethered to our past selves by a rope of memory. The brain is constantly comparing its current thoughts and inputs with information stored in memory. It asks whether things we are seeing, feeling or thinking, are similar to things recorded in memory cells.  This constant comparison gives us the sense of being embedded in a story, being situated on a landscape of my past and future. But crucially the memory is what is present now in the brain, and the feeling of having a past is generated by current processing. 

These above arguments are supposed to convince you that we are essentially beings in a single moment. But you may ask, surely we feel the flow of time? Surely the feeling of continuity of experience, of travelling smoothly, means that we cannot be instantaneous? Some reflection suggests otherwise. Patients with damage to motion-selective cortex perceive the visual world as a series of still-frames. And stimulating those neurons can generate the sense of visual flow or motion. These neurons work (we think) by holding on to the visual image from half a second ago, and subtracting it from what we see now. The resulting spatial ‘difference signal’ is what indicates to us that there is movement. Similar neurons in the auditory domain are responsible for the sense of continuity and change for sounds and speech. And even the motor system has such cells which conversely trigger future action sequences, which correspond to our feeling of planning. It seems likely - though we don’t have proof - that the sense of time flowing, or our travelling smoothly in time, are generated by similar mechanisms that compare current thoughts with the immediate recent ones, giving a motion-like signal. So ultimately, our sensation of time’s continuity is generated in the present, based on memory.

Why is this important? It means we are only indirectly connected to the past. We can only know that we have a past through memory, which could be fallible. We should assume our memory is correct, though. We have a strong informational connection to our past, which is what makes us feel like we are the same person as we were before. 







# Panpsychism

The perspective can be taken in different directions: at one extreme it leads to a kind of panpsychism. The panpsychism here is not that there is consciousness everywhere, but rather, that I am everywhere. At another extreme, there is some threshold of connectedness that leads to personhood - below which the individual may split or vanish.
