    <p>Sometimes we plan ahead, thinking about future consequences of our actions. 
         Other times, we select actions based only on their immediate reward associations. 
         Planning ahead is crucial to staying healthy, but might be affected by motivation. </p>
    <p>We asked whether hunger affects planned vs directly reinforced action

    <h3>Focal damage to frontal cortex reduces decision biases</h3>
    <p>Learning from reinforcement is a classic way to study how brain areas contribute to adaptive behaviour. The most frontal parts of the brain probably contribute at a very high, abstract level.

    <p>Healthy people are biased by previous choices, and by competing information, when making these 
        \"meta-cognitive\" estimates. However, patients with selective damage to the 
        medial prefrontal cortex lacked these biases. 
        They were effectively better at this. 
        One patient had lesions on both the left and the right side,

    <h3>Parkinson\'s medication  has opposite effects on two kinds of motivation</h3>
    <p>Patients with Parkinson\'s disease lack the brain chemical dopamine. 
        Dopamine is thought to signal upcoming rewards, 
        and this might explain why patients on treatment can develop impulse control disorders.</p>
    <p>My lab is studying two different ways to motivate people. 
        One way is to reward or punish them based on how well they do 
        -- like <em>performance-related</em> pay. 
        The other way is to promise a <em>guaranteed</em> reward, 
        which also tends to keep people motivated (even though they don\'t have to). 
        Both these kinds of motivation have been linked to dopamine in different ways.</p>
    <p>In <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58321">our study</a> 
        (<img class="wp-image-574" style="width: 60px;" src="http://www.smanohar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/elife_logo.jpg">
        <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58321"><strong>Grogan et al. </strong></a>
        <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58321"><strong> 2021</strong></a>),
         we found that dopamine boosted performance-related motivation. 
         This may be because it helps patients act \'instrumentally\', 
         amplifying the contingency between their actions and the rewards. 
         And surprisingly, dopamine also reduced the effect of guaranteed rewards. </p>
         <p>The results suggest that giving dopamine in Parkinson\'s doesn\'t directly increase reward sensitivity, 
            but rather, increases the coupling between incentives and actions. </p>

    <h4>Motivation is what drives us to act. Many diseases alter motivation. </h4>
    <p>Damage to some brain areas causes abnormal, 
        <strong>misdirected motivation </strong>--
         sometimes leading to compulsive stereotyped behaviours, 
        or unplanned impulsive acts.  This can sometimes be dramatic,
         causing considerable embarassment for patients and their families.
    </p>
    <p>
        A loss of motivation results in <strong>clinical apathy </strong>
        -- a disabling disorder that can be difficult to pin down.
        It is often missed, and is hard to quantify. 
        It carries a huge social and economic burden, 
        and is often frustrating and distressing for carers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We study what motivation is, in terms of computations. 
        Is it the selection of an appropriate action, 
        given a goal? Or is it the willingness to invest energy, 
        at a cost, in a rewarding course of action?  We found that:

    <h3>Working Memory</h3>
    <p>Working memory is our ability to hold information in mind, 
        for short periods of time. 
        It can be disrupted by almost any brain problem. 
        It has been difficult to pinpoint where and how such immediate memories are held. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We study short-term visual memories, measuring our memory capacity,  
        how memories decay, and are disrupted by irrelevant information.
    </p>
    <p>Recently we have developed a neural model of working memory, 
        proposing a very simple network. It is unlike previously proposed mechanisms, 
        because it suggests that the patterns of brain activity do not correspond 
        to what we are remembering. Rather, 
        rapid interference leads to highly variable -- 
        but predictable -- codes in prefrontal cortex. 
        "Neural mechanisms of attending to items in working memory",

    <h3>Are working memory and visual search windows into the same neural process?</h3>
    <p>When you recall an item from memory, 
        a prompt usually brings associated parts of that item into mind. 
        Could this process be the same thing that occurs when you search 
        for a visual target? 
    </p>
    <p> We tested a neural model designed to perform working memory tasks, 
        to see if it could also perform visual search.</p>
    <p> The model retrieves information when a partial cue re-activates
         a pattern of neurons by associative pattern completion. 
         This same process could occur when we look for an item 
         that we have in mind: the target in mind corresponds 
         to information in memory, 
         and the display that must be searched corresponds to
          a (complicated) retrieval cue. 
    </p>
    <p> We found that when pattern completion 
        is applied to the search display, 
        the memory item \"amplifies\" matching features 
        in the display. Remarkably, this reproduces a 
        number of classical findings in the visual search literature.
    </p>
    <p> Importantly, the model also gets some things wrong.
         This shows us that there are certain mechanistic
          differences between memory and search. </p>
