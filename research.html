            The Computational Neurology Lab studies the brain using computational models. 
            Our research focuses on understanding how the brain processes information, 
            controls movement, and regulates behavior. We uses a combination of experimental
            techniques and mathematical models to investigate the neural mechanisms 
            underlying perception, 
            cognition, and action. Our work has applications in artificial intelligence,
            robotics, and clinical neuroscience.
