On the fear of dying


# Abstract: 
Neurobiology supports panpsychism. This kind of panpsychism paints a different picture of what time is. This leads to a different appreciation of the nature of life and death.   

# Introduction

When we look around, other people seem to be conscious. If that’s true, then a question immediately presents itself:  
Q1: Why am I in my body, not yours? If there’s very similar processes in each brain that can be experienced, then why do I only experience the things in my brain? 

One attempt to answer the question “Why don’t I experience the thoughts in your head?”,  is the following: If I did experience the thoughts in your head, then it would not be me any more, it would be you. However this begs the question, because I am experiencing my own thoughts, but I can imagine that I might be experiencing yours. 

Brain A	Brain B
    |                       |
  Me		  You


A second attempt may be to state that the contents of my brain -- let’s call it  brain A,  are different to  your brain, brain B, in some peculiar way, and I -- the experiencing I -- have some idiosyncratic property that makes me experience only those thoughts in brain A, not B. However, if we accept that brain B could support experience, then  it seems that no physical fact could determine which of brains A and B I would experience. [Pairing problem, Kim 1973]. So we end up denying physicalism and requiring some strange dualistic connections between each brain and its consciousness. 


A more sophisticated answer to this question is to notice something about the things that a particular brian can think. Brain A cannot access much of the information in brain B. It is quite isolated. In fact, even if the I was experiencing thoughts in both brain A and brain B, I would not know it. In other words, I am experiencing only the information, ideas, and thoughts that are represented in those brains. Brain A contains representations of the world from its point of view, but has no way of comparing or contrasting those representations with those in brain B. As such, there are thoughts about brain A’s view,  and about brain B’s view, but there are no thoughts about there being both views. And, there are no thoughts about there being neither view. I simply could not know that I am experiencing multiple brains’ thoughts! And I could not know because the individual brains have no wiring, no content, to represent that.

Consider a scotoma. A scotoma occurs when a part of the visual cortex is damaged, by a stroke for instance. We lose vision in one part of the visual field. If it’s in peripheral vision, most people do not notice this loss. It is as invisible as your blind spot. Most people don’t even know they have one, let alone where it is. Of course, by careful self-testing, you can find it, and eventually people turn up to hospital with scotomas. This is quite different to what happens if your retina is damaged. After retinal damage, people see a hole in their vision. This seems to be because the corresponding regions of visual cortex are not activated by the retina, and “see the hole”. Though this metaphor invokes a homunculus, it does illustrate the point that if information is not computed or represented in the brain, it is not experienced. I argue that, even if I were experiencing both brain A and B contents, the lack of any joint representation -- whether comparative or conjunctive -- is a scotoma. The scotoma here is that the conscious experience of thoughts A and B lacks any connective between them, and therefore it’s not obvious that you are experiencing both. The thoughts of A and B are experienced as two separate conscious streams: as two separate people. This happens even if there is only one fundamental consciousness experiencing both A and B, because of the scotoma. 

This is a rather unusual way to define a person. It is somewhat of a “negative” definition.  It would amount to persons being defined by a **_lack of representation_** of the connection between the representations in one brain and other brains. We could also say that our experience of having only one point of view could be an artefact of a lack of combined information between my brain and others. Perhaps I am experiencing all people’s thoughts; but it’s just that there’s an invisible and impenetrable wall between them. Or even more provocatively: perhaps my existential solitude is an illusion.  It is an essential illusion, due to the architecture of brains. 

# Information connectivity
One strange corollary of this view is that what makes me a separate person from you is a physical fact: there aren’t any connections between our brains. 
There are a number of interesting issues here. Firstly, our brains are already connected, a little bit. I hear you speak, for example. Second, the connections can be weaker or stronger. [[This would mean that I can be partially the same person as you.]] Third, it can change over time: perhaps we can connect our brains together, and fuse two people into one. Fourth, I could sever my brain and I could perhaps end up with multiple consciousnesses - this has been suggested to happen in split brain patients (Gazzaniga).


Fifth, connections are not simply weak or strong: there is an important issue of which bit is connected to which bit. I’m connected to the world via my visual cortex and motor cortex. Stimulating visual cortex causes an external perception. In contrast, stimulating downstream areas causes internal thoughts and ideas to change, without a clear perception of something external. A similar thing happens in the motor system: stimulating M1 causes an action without an intention, but stimulating upstream cortex causes intentions to act, and even further upstream is expected to change our thoughts and desires. Neurons all over the brain talk to each other, but some of those messages are experienced as external: perceiving or acting. Other messages are experienced as internal.
  

# Time
If we are only weakly connected to each other, then we should also consider how well we are connected to ourselves. Bertrand Russell (?) once said: “For all I know, I might have been born yesterday.” What he meant was that, although we have memories of our past, we don’t know for sure if they are true. 
We know that our memories are fallible - and may be partly reconstructed based on statistics, without our awareness
We know that stimulating memory centres can cause deja vu, whereas damage can cause false memories (confabulation)
So can we be sure we existed a few seconds ago? Perhaps not for sure. We are tethered to our past selves by a rope of memory. The brain is constantly comparing its current thoughts and inputs with information stored in memory. It asks whether things we are seeing, feeling or thinking, are similar to things recorded in memory cells.  This constant comparison gives us the sense of being embedded in a story, being situated on a landscape of my past and future. But crucially the memory is what is present now in the brain, and the feeling of having a past is generated by current processing. 

These above arguments are supposed to convince you that we are essentially beings in a single moment. But you may ask, surely we feel the flow of time? Surely the feeling of continuity of experience, of travelling smoothly, means that we cannot be instantaneous? Some reflection suggests otherwise. Patients with damage to motion-selective cortex perceive the visual world as a series of still-frames. And stimulating those neurons can generate the sense of visual flow or motion. These neurons work (we think) by holding on to the visual image from half a second ago, and subtracting it from what we see now. The resulting spatial ‘difference signal’ is what indicates to us that there is movement. Similar neurons in the auditory domain are responsible for the sense of continuity and change for sounds and speech. And even the motor system has such cells which conversely trigger future action sequences, which correspond to our feeling of planning. It seems likely - though we don’t have proof - that the sense of time flowing, or our travelling smoothly in time, are generated by similar mechanisms that compare current thoughts with the immediate recent ones, giving a motion-like signal. So ultimately, our sensation of time’s continuity is generated in the present, based on memory.

Why is this important? It means we are only indirectly connected to the past. We can only know that we have a past through memory, which could be fallible. We should assume our memory is correct, though. We have a strong informational connection to our past, which is what makes us feel like we are the same person as we were before. 


The lonely consciousness
One possible view arising here is that there are millions of disconnected consciousnesses. One at every moment of time in your life, and this for every person who has existed. This view is consistent with the fact we cannot know for sure that we have a past, and we cannot know for sure what another person’s consciousness is like. We are ultimately extremely lonely. Lonelier than any solipsist has ever imagined: we are alone in the very instant in which we think. We cannot even talk to ourself. Any past or future we have, we are isolated from, except for information we extrapolate from memory or planning. 

However would argue that this view is untenable. First, we can place some confidence in the existence of a past self, even if we have only indirect knowledge. There’s nothing terribly wrong about indirect knowledge. Second, it leads to a fundamental problem of knowing when a consciousness is multiple vs the singular. Imagine there are two people. If we connect their brains partially, when do they become one consciousness? Or if parts of my brain become gradually less disconnected, when do they split into multiple consciousnesses? Third, it does result in a huge multiplication of the number of entities. And fourth, there is some kind of symmetry between our separation from other people, and our concordance with our past selves.  You may want to say people are separate because of the spatial information barriers between them. But then shouldn’t you also say that I am not my past self, because of the temporal information barriers between my present and past?#

On this last point about space and time symmetry, you could actually take both horns of this dilemma, as long as you don’t mind stipulating informational cutoffs. Clearly, my brain has a lot more information about my past brain than it does about someone else’s current brain. But this could be seen as a quantitative difference. 
The scotoma for other people
A key thing to notice throughout this argument is that I simply don’t have the brain cells to allow me to know certain things. In visual perception, if you damage a section of your retina, you will see a dark spot. You will notice that you cannot see in a certain part of the world. However, if you damage the corresponding part of your visual cortex, you do not see any dark spot. Patients simply do not realise they have a visual problem, until they realise they are bumping into things more. It works similarly to our blind spot. There is a region of vision in each eye where we cannot see anything, because there are no receptors in the eye there. For decades the neuroscientific metaphor is that we “fill in” the contents of the blind spot-- hence we do not notice it. But more accurately, we simply have no concept of what it would look like to see something in that space, because we have never had the neural hardware that would serve that function. On a similar vein, we have four types of photoreceptor, and in principle this could allow us to see four dimensions of colour. In the visual cortex we have neurons that compare (subtract) the light coming from pairs of photoreceptor types, but they only perform comparisons between three of the types. In fact, the fourth type are combined into a net signal that is never compared across receptor types. So we can only see three-dimensional colour, not four.

The argument from scotoma is simply that, if we don’t have the cells to perform certain comparisons, then certain kinds of thing do not exist in our experience. For example, since I have no neurons that directly compare events in your brain to those in mine, I do not experience anything about your consciousness. I have a scotoma for other people. That does not mean entail I am not experiencing your thoughts. It only means that the experience I am having related to the events in my brain could not possibly know about it, even if it was also having experiences related to events in your brain. 

This is a subtle argument, but I think it is powerful. The lack of mechanism for generating certain kinds of comparative, or relational thought, can generate an impassable rift. If I were experiencing your thoughts, I could not possibly know that it was the same “me”. 


There is a corollary in the time domain. 

subjective moments are not cognitively ordered.



# The fused consciousness
We are likely a single consciousness.

We are elongated in time.

# What is death?

What have we concluded so far? We commented that our consciousness feels tied to a single person, and extended and ordered in time. Despite this, there are reasons to think that our conscious experience generates its isolation and connection in line with the computations that produce it. Consequently consciousness may span individuals as well as time, without hard edges, but conscious events likely have no specific ordering in time. We also commented that it may be sensible to say that my consciousness is everyone’s consciousness, and transcends time. 

Now all this sounds both obfuscated and bombastic. How can this be interpreted? How can it be useful when we know that each of us is condemned to experiencing only a flow of time of their own? I argue that it carries a number of important consequences.   

First, we can understand the incommensurability of different peoples’ experience. [[ Value function incomparability and the rights of individuals ]]
Second, it tells us that while lives may begin and end, the subjective experience does not really have beginnings or ends. Death is a boundary - you might visualise it as a surface that encloses a volume. 



# Panpsychism, Buddhism, and 

The perspective can be taken in different directions: at one extreme it leads to a kind of panpsychism. The panpsychism here is not that there is consciousness everywhere, but rather, that I am everywhere. At another extreme, there is some threshold of connectedness that leads to personhood - below which the individual may split or vanish. 

Another direction is to consider the possibility that the degree of computational connection between individuals is not fixed, and is physically determined. This gives us the possibility of transcending our solitude. While some religions propose this can be done through thought alone, I think it does require some real re-wiring. 

But ultimately, we are discussing the future of the universe, and its relation to conscious beings that apprehend it. In this context, we do not
