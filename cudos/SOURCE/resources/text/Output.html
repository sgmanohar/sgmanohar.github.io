This component allows values to be plotted on the graph at the bottom.

In addition, if an output component is selected, then a sound can be produced that represents the time-dependent waveform of this output. Select the output you are interested in listening to, then press the menu button (the up-arrow at the bottom left of the screen), select Edit, then Sound.
After a few seconds, a 1-second sound will be generated.
